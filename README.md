# burger2
In this assignment, you're going to Sequelize the `Burger` app you made last unit. We've split this exercise into three different tiers, all with different tasks and expectations. Finish whichever tier will provide you with the most reasonable challenge.

### Before you Begin

1. Create a new folder called `sequelizedBurger`
2. Copy the contents of your completed assignment from last unit.
   * Remove the older git connection with `rm -R .git`.
   * Then connect this folder with a new github repo.
3. Run `sequelize init` to create the necessary files.

4. **Note**: If for any reason you don't have a finished assignment for last unit, no problem. Message the instructor, who will provide you will a skeleton file to work of for this unit.
